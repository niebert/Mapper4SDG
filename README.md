## Acknowledgement
Special thanks to the following individual developers and teams of OpenSource JavaScript projects:
* [JSON-Editor](https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor) by Jeremy Dorn. The JSON Editor takes a JSON Schema and uses it to generate an HTML form. The JSON-Editor is partially used to edit JSON file of the Javascript Project in ___JSCC___ . The schemes of the JSON subtree are stored in the folder ___/tpl___ of the JavascriptClassCreator. The full potential of the JSON-Editor was not used in ___JSCC___ . This can be approved in the future.
The JSON-Editor of Jeremy Dorn has full support for JSON Schema version 3 and 4 and can integrate with several popular CSS frameworks (bootstrap, foundation, and jQueryUI). This would lead to major code reduction of ___JSCC___ . Refactoring of ___JSCC___ would make more use of the JSON-Editor features. Check out an interactive demo (demo.html): http://jeremydorn.com/json-editor/
* Developer [Mihai Bazon](http://lisperator.net/) create UglifyJS, a great tool to handle and parse Javascript Code and minify the Javascript code (see [Source Code of UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)). 
* The wrapper for UglifyJS is written [Dan Wolff](http://danwolff.se/). His UglifyJS-Online example is used to minify/compress the exported Javascript code of generated JS Classes (For Online Example of the [UglifyJS-Wrapper](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/) see source code on https://github.com/Skalman/UglifyJS-online for the Online-Version of the Wrapper.
* Developers of ACE Code Editor https://ace.c9.io (Javascript Editing uses the Editor in iFrames)
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) Developer Eli Grey provided the ___FileSaver.js___ that is used to store created ___JSCC___ files to the local filesystem. ___JSCC___ uses the same mechanism of browsers, that allows a ___Save as...___ in the context menu of a web pages or image. So not uncontrolled write access to your file system is implemented, because users have to select the locations in which the user whats to store the file (e.g. JSON, Javascript or HTML).
* [JointJS](https://github.com/clientIO/joint) JointJS is a JavaScript diagramming library. It can be used to create either static diagrams. JointJS is used in this project to create UML-diagrams, that are interactive diagramming in conjunction and application builder in Javascript.
* [Inheritage for JavaScript with protoypes](http://phrogz.net/js/classes/OOPinJS2.html) by Gavin Kistner
* [3 ways to define a JavaScript class](https://www.phpied.com/3-ways-to-define-a-javascript-class/) by Stoyan Stefanov
* [JQuery](https://jqueryui.com) is used for the theme and standard operations in the Document Object Model (DOM) of HTML-pages. The [JQuery-Themeroller](https://jqueryui.com/themeroller/) was used to create a JQuery theme for JSCC.
